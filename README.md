# IntersectionOfTwoLinkedLists
LeetCode 160 Intersection of Two Linked Lists in Java

This is an interesting problem. We are given two singly
linked lists which may or may not intersect. We need
to find the intersection node.

Things get very interesting when we are asked to do so
in Runtime: O(n + m) and Space: O(1).

If interested in my comments I invite you to read the 
following post in my blog:

Keep in mind that one of the bests way to learn is to
read and experiment. Practice makes perfect; at least that
is what I was told.

Enjoy;
